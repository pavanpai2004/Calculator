### This is a Calculator App with two different implementations: SimpleCalculator and LambdaCalculator. 

* simplecalculator includes four basic operations — add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
The user enters two operands and an operator, and the program computes and displays the result.
Exception handling is used to manage division by zero errors gracefully.

* lambdacalculator demonstrates the use of Java lambda expressions.
It defines a functional interface called MathOperator, which contains a single abstract method — operate().
Depending on the user’s input, a specific lambda function is applied to perform the chosen mathematical operation.
